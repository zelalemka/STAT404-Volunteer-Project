STAT404 Volunteer Project

Our project's plan is to perform a regression analysis to investigate the factors influencing students' final grades. Specifically, we conducted an anonymous survey targeting STAT 305 overall grades using five predictors:

1. Weekly study hours dedicated to the course outside of lecture time.
2. Number of class absences/missed lectures.
4. When did the student enroll in STAT 305 (2020/2021/2022)
5. Number of STAT courses taken prior to enrolling in this particular class.
6. Level of enjoyment about the subject or class

We will perform our regression analysis by expanding the following

1. exploration plot
2. build the linear model (lm function)
3. Model diagnostic (qqnorm plot, R^2, Sum of Squares)
4. Hypothesis testing on beta
5. Get the confidence interval
6. Use it for prediction and get prediction interval
